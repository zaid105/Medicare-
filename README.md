# Medicare Analytics Project

## Overview
Unlock the potential of Medicare data with our Medicare Analytics Project! This project leverages machine learning to gain insights into healthcare patterns and improve decision-making in the Medicare domain.

## Key Objectives
Analyze and interpret Medicare data to identify trends and patterns.
Develop a predictive model to enhance understanding of healthcare utilization.
Contribute to data-driven decision-making for healthcare providers and policymakers.
Target Audience
Our project is tailored for data scientists, healthcare professionals, and policymakers interested in harnessing the power of data to improve healthcare outcomes.<br><br>
## Features:
Tot_Rndrng_Prvdrs: Total number of rendering providers.<br>
Tot_Benes: Total number of beneficiaries.<br>
Tot_Srvcs: Total number of services.<br>
Tot_Bene_Day_Srvcs: Total number of beneficiary day services.<br>
Avg_Sbmtd_Chrg: Average submitted charge.<br>
Avg_Mdcr_Pymt_Amt: Average Medicare payment amount.<br>

## Machine Learning Approach
Our approach involves employing a Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost algorithm to model and predict healthcare utilization patterns. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to uncover hidden insights and provide actionable information.

## Expected Benefits
Identify potential areas for healthcare optimization and resource allocation.
Enhance understanding of factors influencing healthcare service usage.
Facilitate evidence-based decision-making for healthcare providers.
## Technologies Used
Python<br>
pandas, scikit-learn<br>
Jupyter Notebooks<br>
## Call to Action
